            <h2>HTML (1993)</h2>
            <h3>HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</h3>
            <img src="/images/html.png" alt="html Logo"> 
<p>HTML is developed in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee . Initially, HTML was designed to create simple web pages with basic formatting and linking capabilities. Over the years, HTML has evolved through various versions, including HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01 , and HTML5 . HTML5 introduced new features like video and audio support, canvas etc . Today, HTML is a cornerstone of web development, used to create structured and visually appealing web pages, web applications, and mobile applications. Its versatility and compatibility with other technologies like CSS and JavaScript have made HTML an essential skill for web developers and designers.

            <h2>C (1972)</h2>
            <h3>First high-level language.</h3>
            <img src="/images/c.png" alt="C Logo">
<p>C was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan at Bell Labs. Initially called "New B," it was later renamed C and rewritten in itself, making it a self-hosting language. C's impact on the programming world has been significant, influencing the development of languages like C++, Java, and Python. Its portability and efficiency made it a crucial language for systems programming, embedded systems, and operating system development, including the creation of Unix. Today, C remains a widely used and influential language in the programming community.</p>

            <h2>PYTHON(1991)</h2>
            <h3>Versatile and easy-to-learn</h3>
            <img src="/images/python.png" alt="python Logo">
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. First released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an ideal language for beginners and experts alike. Its versatility and large standard library enable developers to build applications in various domains. Python's popularity has grown significantly over the years, becoming one of the most widely used programming languages, especially in data science, machine learning, and automation. Python has become a popular choice for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more, due to its simplicity and large standard library.</p>

            <h2>JAVA(1995)</h2>
            <h3>First object-oriented language .</h3>
            <img src="/images/java.png" alt="java Logo">
<p>Java was first released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, founded by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton. Initially called "Oak," Java was designed to create interactive television content, but its platform-independent capabilities made it ideal for web development. Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, achieved through its virtual machine (JVM), allowed programs to run on any device supporting Java, without modification.Java is widely used for building enterprise-level applications, Android apps, web applications, and games .Today, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages, known for its simplicity, portability, and versatility.</p>
